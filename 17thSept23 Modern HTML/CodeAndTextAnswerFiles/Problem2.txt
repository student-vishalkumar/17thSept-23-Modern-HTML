What are HTML Entities?
 A text fragment (or "string") that starts with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;) is known as an HTML entity. Entities are widely used to show unseen characters, such as non-breaking spaces and reserved characters, which would be read as HTML code. Additionally, you may substitute them for other characters that are challenging to enter on a regular keyboard.

Five commonly used html entities-

1) &gt - greate than

2) &nbsp - non-breaking space

3) &it - less than

4) &amp - ampersand

5) &quot - double quotation mark
